        <h3>AM:</h3>
        <p>Completed flashcard sets for the day.</p>
        <h3>PM:</h3>
        <p>Worked on server-side of web app. This is not for actual personal use but to help someone with their coursework. It seems that frameworks and libraries change quite quickly so I've had to look for reasons why the program I had built three months ago was no longer working. It could also be that I don't really know Javascript. On the plus side, and this may really be the only plus thign about spending time on this project for a second time, I may actually be able to write about it on this very website, so that would be some nice varied content.
        <p>Picked up a metal chest of drawers for a DIY upcycling project. Pictures will follow on a dedicated post.</p>
