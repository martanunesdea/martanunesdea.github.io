<h1>Authentication with Crypto++</h1>
        <h3>A portable program for bigger projects</h3>
        
        <p>As authentication starts to become an essential requirement for most projects, I decided to make a quick program that allows this in C++. I'm aware it needs a few less lines of code in other languages, but ultimately the idea is that the program would be associated with a C++ project.</p>
        <h2>Step 1. Get input username and password</h2>
        <p>First, open up your editor and add the boilercode needed to get going with C++. Get an username and password from the user.</p>

        <h2>Step 2. Generate a hash from the password</h2>
        <p>For this, I first used the standard's hash library but, upon realising that it does not guarantee the hash to be unbreakable, I got a bit dissappointed. The most popular solution for cryptography-related functions in C++ is Crypto++.</p>
        <h3>Install and add Crypto++ to Cpp files</h3>
        <p>The first impression is that the documentation for Crypto++ is a bit sparse but, there seems to be enough people working on it that the installation process has been made quite simple.</p>
        <p>1. Download the zip folder and extract the contents.</p>
        <p>2. Once installed, from the command line run: </p>
        <div class="code">
          <p>> make</p>
          <p>> make test</p>
          <p>> install</p>
        </div>
        <p>3. Once it's installed, you've got to reference the crypto++ folder in your makefile, and you've got to link the actual compiled library file (libcryptopp.a) into the makefile.</p>
        <div class="code">
          <p class="comment"># Makefile</p>
          <p>CXX=clang++</p>
          <p>CXXFLAGS = -Wall -std=c++17</p>
          <p class="comment"># Use the directory that contains the boost directory</p>
          <p>CRYPTO_LIBRARIES = ./cryptopp840</p>
          <p>LFLAGS += -L$(CRYPTO_LIBRARIES)</p>
          <p>all: main</p>
          <p>main: main.cpp</p>
          <p> $(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) main.cpp -o main $(LFLAGS) -lcryptopp</p>
          <p>clean: </p>
          <p> rm -rf main</p>
        </div>
        <p>Then, the correct header files need to be included from your cpp source file. And of course, you've got to work out how to generate a hash using Crypto++.</p>
        <h3>Implement the hashing function for strings</h3>
        <p>I went through a couple of examples from the Crypto++ documentation wiki and ended up with this as the final code: </p>

        <h2>Step 3. Validate hashed password with stored hashes.</h2>
        <p>Ok, this is sort of like two steps really.</p>
        <div class="code">
        <p>Hello;</p>
        <p>std::cout << "this is how you write C++ code" << std::endl</p>
        </div>
