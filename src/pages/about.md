I'm a software developer in embedded systems, with an interest in web technology and data applications. Lately, I've also developed an interest for the "maker" movement and DIY, I'm converting a van into a camper van.
          
Currently, I'm working as a software engineer in Research & Development of a medical device company. I enjoy the logical work involved in embedded software development (it really is a love/hate relationship with C). I am a natural curious wanderer and I enjoy learning about new topics on my spare time (tech and non tech alike, although I do try to keep this blog mostly tech-centred). Some of the topics I am learning about at the moment: networks, Linux and handling large file I/O in a codebase.
