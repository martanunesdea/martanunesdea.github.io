Bluetooth can be a multi-client network but the simplest network only requires two devices: a host and a client. Normally, the host is the device providing the information and the client is the one requesting it. 

In order to get this network to communicate, it is necessary to establish the following points:
- Who is the host device? And who is the client device?
- How is the connection going to be established? Security considerations regarding this.
- How is the data going to be transferred? Plus data integrity considerations regarding this.

Depending on the application, there may be other things that need a detailed consideration but for most people wanting to develop a marketable application this should suffice.
