<h1>Getting BLE to work - Connecting</h1>
<p>02 May 2021</p>
</div>
<div class="post">
<p>Bluetooth can be a multi-client network but the simplest network only requires two devices: a host and a client. Normally, the host is the device providing the information and the client is the one requesting it.</p>
<p>In order to get this network to communicate, it is necessary to establish the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which device starts the connection? Which device accepts the connection?</li>
<li>How is the connection going to be established?</li>
<li>Security considerations regarding the connection link.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Device roles</h1>
<p>The roles of a device may vary based on the stages of the protocol. This is a simplified version of how to distinguish between these.</p>
<h2>Advertisement</h2>
<p>A device may be a &quot;broadcaster&quot; if it is advertising, or an &quot;observer&quot; if it is scanning for devices.</p>
<h2>Connection</h2>
<p>Then, a device may be a &quot;peripheral&quot; if it requests a connection, or a &quot;central&quot; device, if it accepts a connection.</p>
<h2>Communication</h2>
<p>Lastly, when communicating through ATT, a device becomes a &quot;client&quot; when asking for information, and another device the &quot;server&quot; that provides that information.</p>
<h1>Establishing a connection</h1>
<p>In a scenario with low security requirements, connecting can be as easy as, finding a Bluetooth device and issuing a conenction command to it. (This is assuming you have access to the Bluetooth's module library or API).</p>
<p>Provided the &quot;central&quot; device is willing to connect, it will accept and connect. This functionality is enabled through GAP: it discovers devices available and attempts to connect.</p>
<h1>Security implications</h1>
<p>A simple connection relies on the assumption that a device would readily accept any incoming connections but this could a dangerous and vulnerable position. For instance, if that device is also connected with a wide area network, it could be maliciously infected with malware and propagate through the network.</p>
<p>This is why a lot of device require &quot;pairing&quot; as a way to safely confirm that two devices should indeed be connected.</p>
<h2>Pairing and bonding</h2>
<p>Coming soon...</p>
<h1>Final word</h1>
<p>Now we've learned about establishing a connection, in the next article, I will be discussing the use of GATT as means to share data.</p>
