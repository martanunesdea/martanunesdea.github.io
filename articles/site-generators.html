        <h1>Website design choices</h1>
        <h2>The lifecycle of my personal site</h2>
        <h3>HTML, CSS, Javascript</h3>
        <p>Last summer, I got a bit too much FOMO from all the enthusiasm for shiny front-end websites and decided to learn how to do it myself. I had learn HTML and CSS at a short course whilst at university, and I knew a bit about back end development so was keen to delve a bit deeper and understand how websites work, from start to finish.
        </p>
        <p>On I went, going through the whole list of posts on Mozilla's Web Foundation webiste, from the very basics of HTML (although going a bit quickly through these posts), up until I got to React, Vue and Ember.</p>
        <p>Once I got to the front-end frameworks, I figured I didn't actually have to learn all three of them, as I had already set my mind on using GatsbyJS. A framework that uses React to generate static sites. I thought that would be a good use of my time, rather than learning React and using it to build a static site generator, I may as well use an existing framework that seems to have reliable documentation and online support.</p>
        <h3>GatsbyJS</h3>
        <p>And so it went. I learned quite a bit of the Gatsby processes, only to realise that once the websites got deployed, there was a weird zooming effect that happened with the Gatsby sites. As someone who had spent quite a lot of time trusting that things in Gatsby just worked magically, I was a bit frustrated. Anyway, I later came to realise that this is an issue that can be solved, but as mentioned above, I wasn't the most Javascript-savvy person and I was sure that there were many other alternatives to me sorting out some obscure zooming problem.</p>
        <p>So, I trashed out that Gatsby project and attempted to borrow existing Gatsby templates (that is a thing). That went adequately but, in the end, I was still a bit frustrated with how GraphQL worked.In hindsight, maybe I should have allocated a solid week or two to understand the basics of how to interact with GraphQL, or how to work with React. But, I'm a full-time employed developer myself, I had other things taking up my time and energy.</p>
        <h3>VueJS</h3>
        <p>On a funny twist of fate, a couple of months down the line, I got asked by a few students to help them with some web development coursework using Vue. I thought I would be able to know, from my long weeks crash coursing on how the DOM works, asynchronous Javascript, and other bits and bobs. So I looked up Vue and read about how it works. It's really actually quite simple!</p>
        <p>So I learned it myself, and then I tutor the students who needed help to create a web app.</p>
        <h3>Full circle: Bare bones HTML and CSS, again</h3>
