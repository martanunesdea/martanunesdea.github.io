        <h1>A text file parser for recipe management</h1>
        <h3>Automation of meal prepping</h3>

        <p>Since cooking most of our meals during the past months, we've managed to prepare 80 different recipes. I am using this as the start of a recipe helper bot to decide the meals to make for the week.</p>
        <h2>Step 1. Accumulate recipe data</h2>
        <p>We used google sheets for this. See below for how our calendar of meal planning looks like: </p>
        <div class="box-rectangle"><img src="meal_plan.png" alt="meal planning" class="contain"></div>
        <h2>Step 2. Choosing programming environment: C++ or Python?</h2>
        <p>TLDR; I chose Python because it is easier to integrate with database drivers, user interface libraries and more dynamic.</p>
        <p>Initially, I was very keen to use C++ to build this app. The motivation for this comes from a previous university project that I had developed which was a search engine for proteins. I thought if I was able to build that for proteins, it should be easier to do it with recipes, right? But after dedicating it a couple of weekends, I realised it would be a bit trickier.</p>
        <p>In my first attempt to write this in C++, I got a bit stuck with the design of my classes and the data structures to use. I played around with unordered maps, only to read more into the subject and realise that a vector of vectors was probably going to work well for me.</p>
        <p>A vector of vectors seems to be a very standard way of solving problems, many people in the C++ community seem to recommend more specific data structures if you know your application meets the specific requirements to benefit from these (e.g. if you're doing look-up only but no inserting, or if you know you're only going to append, not insert). Anyway, I was happy with a vector of vectors so on I went, parsed a couple of recipe's data into a vector of vectors of course, organised into objects. However, I then realised my separation of concerns led to a lot of dependencies, which rendered the OO approach a bit useless.</p>
        <p>I left the program on idle for a couple of months and eventually experimented with Flask and SQLite on Python. The rate of development was so much quicker that it made me question whether I had been choosing the wrong programming set-up all along.</p>
        <p>A couple of months past and by now, I had also spent some time working with Tkinter, to tutor a younger kid how to program with Python. It is a fairly limited UI library, but it does the job. Since I'm not looking to sell or give out this app, I'm happy for the UI to be fairly limited. Besides, if I manage to make my services independent, I should be able to port it onto Flask and a basic HTML/CSS website if I wish to do so in the future.</p>
        </p>
        <h2>Step 3. Connect Python to DB</h2>
        <p>From my initial attempts of building the app in C++, I already had a text file full of recipe names and ingredients list. Up until now, I was reading the file and parsing the words into specific-purpose data structures. I eventually ended up with a "recipe" list, which had all of the recipe titles, and a "recipe-details" item, which included the recipe title and the required ingredients.</p>
        <p>I knew that MongoDB would lend itself well for this application, because I could keep a JSON record per recipe. MongoDB was so easy to setup when I used it with Javascript, I knew it couldn't be any different with Python. The whole thing took me about 10 minutes or less. The below is a snippet of code on how to write a db connection when using MongoDB, although it may be easier to look it up on Mongo's documentation <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/languages/python">here</a>. </p>
        <pre><code> 
    import pymongo

    def get_database():
        # Provide the mongodb atlas url to connect python to mongodb using pymongo
        CONNECTION_STRING = "mongodb+srv://yourusername:yourpass@cluster0.sbchk.mongodb.net/recipe-db?retryWrites=true&w=majority"

        # Create a connection using MongoClient. You can import MongoClient or use pymongo.MongoClient
        client = pymongo.MongoClient(CONNECTION_STRING)

        return client['recipe-db']
        </code></pre>

        <p>Then, to insert items into the database:</p>
        <pre><code>
    def db_insert(item):
        dbname = get_database()
        collection_name = dbname["recipes"]
        result = collection_name.insert(item)
        print(result)
        </code></pre>
