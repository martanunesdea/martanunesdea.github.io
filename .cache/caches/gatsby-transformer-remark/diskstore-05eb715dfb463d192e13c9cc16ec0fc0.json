I used SpaCy about two years ago, and it was already very user-friendly back in the day. However, since it was based on Cython, I was left with the curiosity to try NLP in the C++ environment.</p>\n<h2>Development diaries</h2>\n<h3>Day 1 - Getting started</h3>\n<p>I have practiced the C++ capabilities with input streams when using the fstream header file and that´s been working as expected. I can separate text files into words and add those onto a vector.</p>\n<p>I will be researching a bit and brushing up on tokenization next, I would like to have a rough idea on the topic of the document...</p>\n<h3>Day 2 - Vectorisation</h3>\n<p>I have managed to get a text file onto a vector data structure. For the time being, I will be using vectors as the built-in support for these is quite good. I also have an idea that a lot of NLP libraries use vectors to store containers of words, etc. But when I have got some more time, I would like to research if there are any other structures providing more benefits.</p>\n<p>At the moment, I have only just done a print check that the vector contents include all the text content. I have now outlined a few things I would like to do with this vector structure:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rank words by the frequency of use: I am expecting a lot of linking words at the top but would also expect the words ranking just below to be about the topic of the document.</li>\n<li>Rank words by the length of word: This would be useful if it is an academic text. And sometimes the longest words don't get repeated often (ie. not appearing in the first rank) but could be quite important... This is only a theory and if I don't get promising results I will probably discard this feature.</li>\n<li>Categorise words: This will categorise words based on their nature, for instance noun, verb, adjective, etc. I will probably need a third party library at this point. And I am not sure the results will be very repeatable but I'm curious to see the outcome. It's all about the learning experience, really.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I have also decided to add two extra options in this document parser program. The second option will be to categorise the document based on the contents (this would involve looking at the words used and seeing of what nature they are, this will definitely rely on third-party algorithms as my time is sadly not infinte). The third option will be to encrypt the document, this will involve outputting a file that is encrypted, perhaps with the encryption key in a different text based file. Still have to consider a few things, so it all might change.</p>\n<h3> Day 3, 4 and 5 - Iterators and searching new tools</h3>\n<p>In an attempt to keep this log somewhat realistic, but without being dragged on to write everytime I'm working, I will write summaries of the progress so far.</p>\n<p>For the past days of working on this project, I have focused on the \"ranking a word by its frequency\" because I thought that could be an interesting exercise to force me to brush up on my vector handling skills. However, I managed to get trapped looking for the next-best solution to tackle this type of problem. Thus, this timely pause for reflection.\nPointers and iterators</p>\n<p>From my academic background of C++ at university, I thought I would be making a nifty use of iterators to go through the vector of words, and identify how frequently these are repeated. However, I realised that with C++11 there have been a host of new features added onto the standard library, which has turned a few practices into \"old practices\" with more safer and quicker alternatives to accomplish things. For instance the \"auto\" initialiser and the new form to loop over containers.</p>\n<p>This made me wonder whether there was already a function that would do what I was looking to do, or one that would make it a simpler operation. I was not very successful in achieving this, but I did learn and try out quite a few different things to see how those worked.</p>\n<p>I realised that the issue with keeping track of the frequency of words with a pointer, is that I would need to create another vector of words that have already been counted, and iterate through that before beginning a count for a new word. That would probably succeed in preventing overlaps, but I would rather implement it with hash tables as it could then invalidate the words that have already been counted. Besides, there are loads of new containers that could be used for hash tables so that will force me to get updated on the new additions to the most recent standard.</p>\n<h3> Day 6, 7 - Change to password manager</h3>\n<p>I came to the realisation that NLP was perhaps too much of a hard task to take on without the use of helper libraries of APIs. And even though I am really keen to get my hands on a few NLP libraries, I first would like to get a bit more used with C++ again. There's been a lot of things that have been implemented in C++ in the past few years and, before I start borrowing function calls from other libraries, I'd like to do a bit more of my own software design and implementation. So I took the pragmatic decision to specify this program to generate random passwords, save them on a database and retrieve them.</p>\n<h3>Day 8, 9 and 10 - Setting up MySQL Connector-C++</h3>\n<p>This will be a long post...</p>\n<p>Download the appropiate binary package from the community downloads page and followed the process. When trying to talk to mysql, it works fine in the appropiate directory but, this isn't the desired outcome, so I changed the PATH variable from my terminal.</p>\n<p>So I got to talk to MySQL and even created my own database and tables within the terminal. But ideally, I'd like to do that from my C++ project. So I downloaded also Connector C++.</p>\n<p>This is a convenient driver that allows MySQL APIs to interact with MySQL. I first struggled with the downloading and linking my existing C++ project with connector C++. I look very close into what the Makefile or CMake should be doing, and I was doing as suggested; including and linking the right files. However for some reason, it wasn't able to identify the library file from within the connector c++ directory. In a desperate attempt, I thought perhaps re-installing the program for Connector C++ wouldn't do any further harm. And so I did. This time, I installed it from a binary and let the process run. Afterwards, I used the suggested Makefile content with a very basic C++ project file and it successfully linked.</p>\n<p>After successfully linking, I was finally quite relieved of at least having achieved something. I then looked for one of the sample code files on how to initiate a session from C++ (using the X dev API). This was not the most straightforward, as I wasn't quite sure which parameters to use to initiate a session but I finally got there...</p>\n<p>I will re-edit and add code excerpts at some point. But these are all the steps I followed.</p>\n<h3> Day 11 - Talking in SQL!</h3>\n<p>Today the progress was much quicker after the previous three days of work to get the setup running. But now that there is a C++ file talking to the MySQL server everything is going smoothly! The folks at MySQL did a good job at creating a good dev guide/tutorial for X Dev API with samples of code (that I am yet to paraphrase here) which makes trying things out quick and easy. Today, I've managed to create a table within the schema for the project, inserting rows and selecting some of the elements in the row and printing them out. I used MySQL on a second terminal to check whether some of these function calls had really worked since (for the time being) I don't know how to identify these errors with commands from the API.</p>\n<p>The insertion of variables into the table was done through hard-coded variables and names initially, but I also managed to append C++ variables with the SQL command and that got executed just as easily (expect code fragment here).</p>\n<p>Next thing to do is to split up this sample code into a nicer structure (it's currently all in one function). And then to try and integrate this source file onto the rest of the project.</p>"}
