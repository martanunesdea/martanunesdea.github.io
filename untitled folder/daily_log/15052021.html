        <h1>Saturday, 15th May 2021</h1>
        <h3>AM:</h3>
        <p>A bit more work on the MEVN site. I finished the integration of ExpressJS with VueJS. All the endpoints on the server are called from Vue, and they seem to be working fine. Even the pictures are loading properly.</p>
        <p>I tried to deploy the backend to Heroku but was not having any luck. The logs said the build was successful and completes the deployment but then, when going to the deployed site, it says there was an error. On inspection of the log, Node says "this is probably not the actual error, there should be more log above this message" and there isn't. Well that's super helpful. Will try again tomorrow and see how that goes. I will also type this all up into one web-dev project when I've got some more quieter days.</p>
        <h3>PM:</h3>
        <p>After researching for the cheapest materials for the upcycling of a chest of metal drawers, I actually went into a shop to buy them. I am missing a respirator mask, so I won't be able to get started until I've got that (not that the weather would have let me do it this weekend anyway..).</p>
