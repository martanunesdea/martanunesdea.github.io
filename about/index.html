        <h1>About</h1>
<p>I'm an engineer working with software and embedded systems. My academic background is in Biomedical Engineering with a focus on Electrical Engineering. From early on, I developed an interest for the inner workings of gadgets, especially those interacting with sensory data. I started my career working with medical devices and have since then moved to the interesting world of Hi Fi (high-end electronics and audio processing combined together, what is not to love?). Outside of my place of work, I've developed an interest for the &quot;maker&quot; movement and DIY, I'm converting a van into a camper van.</p>
<p>I am a natural curious wanderer and I enjoy learning about new topics on my spare time (tech and non tech alike, although I do try to keep this blog mostly tech-centred). In the past, I have spent a slightly absurd amount of time learning about web development, different frameworks such as React, Vue, serveless hosting, server hosting, online performance, etc. Now that my home server is running in the background, I am moving on to other domains. Stay tuned for new content!</p>
